# ECHELON_INVENTORY
This repository provides algorithms to transform a assembly system to a equivalent serial system under 
some reasonable assumptions (e.g. positive echelon holding cost). It also derives lower and upper bounds to guide
how to set echelon base stock levels on the resulting serial system.
